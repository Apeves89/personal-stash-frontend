## Approach Taken

We collaborated on ideas and Joy presented a rough idea she had abandoned from her previous project.  Alexis was interested in attempting a more fleshed out version of that concept, so we decided to create an app for a crafter to catalogue their yarn stash and crochet hooks/knitting needles.  

We built a database with two models ('yarn' and 'hooks').  Then we connected that database to our front end through React.  We used Boostrap to style the page, and implemented a "random color" feature that shwos up on the border of the cards, background card color, header and new item forms.  We also impemented modals to edit each item.


## Unsolved Problems

We were able to accomplish everything we set out to create.  If we had more time, we likely would have attempted "User Authorization" and log-ins.


## User Stories

As a user, I can view all the current skeins of yarn in my stash.   
As a user, I can view all the current crochet hooks and knitting needles I own.   
As a user, I can log when I use certain crochet hooks/needles in projects, and make a note of which project they're currently being used in.   
As a user, I can add to my stash when I purchase new yarn, crochet hooks or knitting needles.   
As a user, I can edit and update quantities, notes and other information about the yarn and hooks/needles in my stash.   
As a user, I can note when I need to replace my current hooks or needles.   
As a user, I can keep track of which needles and hooks are my favorite.   
As a user, I can make note of which sets of DPN's are incomplete.


## Notes to Self
Joy would like to take some elements from this project and impement it into a more in-depth app focused on just knitting needles, which would also include a user login/auth so that it can be used by multiple people.
